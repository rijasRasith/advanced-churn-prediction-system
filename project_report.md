## 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📊 **Key Findings**
1. **Churn Distribution**: 16.1% churn rate indicates moderate imbalance
2. **Age Patterns**: Customers aged 40-50 show highest churn rates
3. **Transaction Behavior**: Low transaction count/amount strongly correlate with churn
4. **Product Usage**: Customers with 1-2 products more likely to churn
5. **Contact Frequency**: High contact frequency indicates potential dissatisfaction

### 🎯 **Business Insights**
- **High-Risk Segments**: Young professionals with low engagement
- **Retention Opportunities**: Customers with declining transaction patterns
- **Product Strategy**: Single-product customers need cross-selling focus
